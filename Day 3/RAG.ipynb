            " Question: What are the main components of a RAG model and how do they interact?\n",
            "Context: retriever p\u0011(zjx)with parameters \u0011that returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001)parametrized 1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform- ers Library [ 66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/ examples/rag/ . An interactive demo of RAG models can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/ 2 by\u0012that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i\u00001tokensy1:i\u00001, the original inputxand a retrieved passage z. To train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p\u0011andp\u0012components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 Models RAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(yjx)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pRAG-Sequence (yjx)\u0019X z2top-k(p(\u0001jx))p\u0011(zjx)p\u0012(yjx;z) =X z2top-k(p(\u0001jx))p\u0011(zjx)NY ip\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001) RAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne: pRAG-Token (yjx)\u0019NY iX z2top-k(p(\u0001jx))p\u0011(zjx)p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001) Finally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR The retrieval component p\u0011(zjx)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: p\u0011(zjx)/exp\u0000 d(z)>q(x)\u0001 d(z) =BERTd(z);q(x) =BERTq(x) where d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8], andq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating top-k (p\u0011(\u0001jx)), the list ofkdocumentszwith highest prior probability p\u0011(zjx), is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory . 2.3 Generator: BART The generator component p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58]\n",
            "documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them. We have the ﬂexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for RAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence. 10 20 30 40 50 KR e t r i e v e dD o c s394041424344NQ Exact MatchRAG-Tok RAG-Seq 10 20 30 40 50 KR e t r i e v e dD o c s4050607080NQ Answer Recall @ KRAG-Tok RAG-Seq Fixed DPR BM25 10 20 30 40 50 KR e t r i e v e dD o c s4850525456Bleu-1 / Rouge-L scoreRAG-Tok R-L RAG-Tok B-1 RAG-Seq R-L RAG-Seq B-1 Figure 3: Left: NQ performance as more documents are retrieved.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [ 5,29], fact checking [ 56], fact completion [ 48], long-form question answering [ 12], Wikipedia article generation [ 36], dialogue [ 41,65,9,13], translation [ 17], and language modeling [ 19,27]. Our work uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. 8 General-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench- marks [ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. Learned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering, using search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be ﬁne-tuned for strong\n",
            "any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against misleading content and automated spam/phishing.
